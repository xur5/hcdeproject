	I&#39;ve been out on that open road.
 You can be my full time daddy, white and gold.
 Singing blues has been getting old.
 But you can be my full time baby, hot or cold.
 Don&#39;t break me down.
 I&#39;ve been traveling too long.
 I&#39;ve been trying too hard.
 With one pretty song.
 I hear the birds on the summer breeze. 
I drive fast. I am alone at midnight. 
Been trying hard not to get into trouble. 
But I, I&#39;ve got a war in my mind. 
So, I just ride. Just ride.
